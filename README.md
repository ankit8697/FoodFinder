## About <a name = "about"></a>

This is an Android application that allows users to upload information and pictures about the leftover food available from events on their campus. It has implemented Firebase as a back-end to allow users to be notified when food is available on campus. You can set a timeout for each food item so that when that particular amount of time has passed, it will automatically remove itself from the database.

## Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

First, fork the repository. Then clone it into Android Studio and hit the run button. You will need to set up your own instance of Firebase and link it to the app, and you will need to update the Google Maps API key to be your own key. Once you have done this, the app should start up and allow users to login and add their apps.
